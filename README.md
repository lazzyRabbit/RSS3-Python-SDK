# RSS3 Python SDK

python3 versionï¼šv3.9.X
This is a python sdk that is not fully accessible yet

## Current issues to be resolved

* Due to time development, the signature issue has not yet been resolved, resulting in the process parameters have not been adjusted temporarily    
  The pits here are encountered during development. It is found that the sign used in eth_keys and rss3 will have incompatibility problems. The compatibility problems of the libraries used here are probably      
  The same problem encountered a similar problem in the official library of go    
  [rss3go_lib](https://github.com/nyawork/rss3go) solves this problem
    
* Due to time development, the test cases are not yet complete
* Due to the development time, we have not kept up with the pace of RSS3-SDK-for-JavaScript. The current version is developed around the first version of RSS3-SDK-for-JavaScript.

## API

### Account

```python
    from rss3_sdk import rss3_accountss
```

#### Generate a new account

```python
    curr_account = rss3_account.RSS3Account()
```

#### Initialize with the original private key

```python
    curr_account = rss3_account.RSS3Account('0xa55afab0f35bdc00c1ac137a98d5d037609eeaead8ba930c4c3878e38630e38a')
```

### RSS3Handle

```python
    from rss3_sdk import rss3_account
```

#### Initialization

```python
    handle = rss3_handle.RSS3Handle(
    endpoint = 'rss3-hub-playground-6raed.ondigitalocean.app',
    rss3_account = curr_account,
    fill_update_callback = fill_update)
```

#### Get and modify item

```python
    # The type of'inn_item' is IInnItem, you can also generate a new one yourself
    
    inn_item = handle.item_get('0x6338ee94fB85e157D117d681E808a34a9aC21f31-item-1')
    inn_item.title = "Change this one"
    handle.item_patch(inn_item)
```

#### User information modification

```python
    # The type of'inn_profile' is IInnProfile, you can also generate a new one yourself
    
    inn_profile = handle.profile_get()
    inn_profile.name = "Child"
    handle.profile_patch(inn_profile)
```

## Next step plan

* Solve the signature problem, adjust the overall interface, complete the release of the first version, and push the toolkit to pip
* Develop with the latest official js version of the SDK, split the module into more detail, and separate the file, item, and items.

## Final appeal
 Since I have too little time and stepped on more pits, I hope that colleagues who have the time can give more valuable opinions and cooperate in development.
